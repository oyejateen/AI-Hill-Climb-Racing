**README.md**

This file provides an overview of the AI-Hill-Climb-Racing project, including its purpose, stack used, and instructions on how to get started. It highlights the use of neataptic for neural network and neuro-evolution.

**FUNCTIONS AND VARS.JS**

This file contains global constants and variables, including the population size, window dimensions, timer settings, and mutation rate. It also initializes the Neataptic neural network library and defines the game world, agents, and rendering engine.

**AGENT.JS**

This file defines the Agent class, which represents the neural network-controlled car in the game. It contains methods for initializing the agent, adding it to the game world, and handling its movement and behavior based on neural network outputs.

**VERTICIES.JS**

This file defines an array of vertices that represent the terrain in the game. The agent's car moves along this terrain, which determines its speed and stability.

**INDEX.HTML**

This file is the HTML structure of the game, including the main game canvas, buttons, and other UI elements. It also includes references to necessary JavaScript files.

**INDEX.JS**

This file is the main game loop. It initializes the game world, sets up event listeners for collisions and terrain detection, and manages the evolution of the neural network population. It also controls the timer and updates the display for the user.
